# Portland-Climate
A timeseries analysis of monthly precipitation and minimum/maximum temperatures between 1940 and 2019. The data was split, maintaining the last twenty years for model validation. ARMA, SARIMA, and Holt-Winterâ€™s models were fit to monthly precipitation, minimum and maximum temperatures. Root mean squared error (RMSE) was used to assess best models. Precipitation was modeled with a SARIMA(0,0,1)x(0,1,1)12 model and resulted in an RMSE of 1.88. Minimum and Maximum temperature were modeled with ARMA models after removing trend and seasonality. Minimum temperature resulted in an RMSE of 2.45 and Maximum temperature with RMSE of 3.08. The models were used to forecast 10 years into the future and predicted stationary precipitation but increasing temperatures. This was a team project, in which I was responsible for fitting the ARMA model to precipitation and all models to temperature data as well as forecasts and data visualizations.
